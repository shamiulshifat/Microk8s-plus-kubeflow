1. Increase the dqlite Timeout
Since dqlite uses SQLite under the hood, it uses locks to maintain data consistency. If your workload or cluster operations are putting heavy load on the datastore, you might see more frequent “database is locked” errors. Increasing the timeout can give operations more time to wait for the lock to clear.

How to Increase the Timeout:
Locate the dqlite Arguments File:

The configuration for dqlite is provided via command-line arguments to the MicroK8s daemon. Typically, you can find the file here:

bash
Copy
/var/snap/microk8s/current/args/dqlite
Edit the File:

Open the file with your preferred editor:

bash
Copy
sudo nano /var/snap/microk8s/current/args/dqlite
Look for a flag such as --timeout. If you see something like:

bash
Copy
--timeout=5000
this value (usually in milliseconds) indicates how long an operation will wait for the lock. Increase it to, for example, 60 seconds (60000 ms):

diff
Copy
- --timeout=5000
+ --timeout=60000
If the flag isn’t present, add it as a new line:

bash
Copy
--timeout=60000
Restart MicroK8s:

For the change to take effect, restart MicroK8s:

bash
Copy
sudo microk8s stop
sudo microk8s start
You can verify the status with:

bash
Copy
sudo microk8s status --wait-ready
