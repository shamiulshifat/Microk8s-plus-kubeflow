1. database locked 500 from argo pods:

1. Increase the dqlite Timeout
Since dqlite uses SQLite under the hood, it uses locks to maintain data consistency. If your workload or cluster operations are putting heavy load on the datastore, you might see more frequent “database is locked” errors. Increasing the timeout can give operations more time to wait for the lock to clear.

How to Increase the Timeout:
Locate the dqlite Arguments File:

The configuration for dqlite is provided via command-line arguments to the MicroK8s daemon. Typically, you can find the file here:

bash
Copy
/var/snap/microk8s/current/args/dqlite
Edit the File:

Open the file with your preferred editor:

bash
Copy
sudo nano /var/snap/microk8s/current/args/dqlite
Look for a flag such as --timeout. If you see something like:

bash
Copy
--timeout=5000
this value (usually in milliseconds) indicates how long an operation will wait for the lock. Increase it to, for example, 60 seconds (60000 ms):

diff
Copy
- --timeout=5000
+ --timeout=60000
If the flag isn’t present, add it as a new line:

bash
Copy
--timeout=60000
Restart MicroK8s:

For the change to take effect, restart MicroK8s:

bash
Copy
sudo microk8s stop
sudo microk8s start
You can verify the status with:

bash
Copy
sudo microk8s status --wait-ready

ISSUE: Microk8s pods logs not working, showing: Issue: Error from server: Get "https://10.13.159.32:10250/containerLogs/argo/ml-fastapi-server-5dfb9d69bf-g8d89/mlfastapiserver": tls: failed to verify certificate: x509: certificate is valid for 10.13.158.243, not 10.13.159.32

Solution:
#first stop microk8s
sudo microk8s stop
#remove current certs
sudo rm -rf /var/snap/microk8s/current/certs/*

# get the node name and IP
sudo microk8s kubectl get nodes -o wide 

# replace node ip with current one
echo '--node-ip=<node ip>' | sudo tee -a /var/snap/microk8s/current/args/kubelet
sudo snap restart microk8s.daemon-kubelite

# open template and here add the node IP as next l;ike IP.2 OR IP.3 whichever is next
The csr.conf.template file dictates how certificates are generated. It's crucial to ensure that all necessary IP addresses are included to prevent mismatche
sudo nano /var/snap/microk8s/current/certs/csr.conf.template

e.g:
IP.3 or IP.2 = <current node ip?
  [ alt_names ]
  DNS.1 = kubernetes
  DNS.2 = kubernetes.default
  DNS.3 = kubernetes.default.svc
  DNS.4 = kubernetes.default.svc.cluster
  DNS.5 = kubernetes.default.svc.cluster.local
  IP.1 = 127.0.0.1
  IP.2 = 10.13.158.32
  IP.3 = 10.13.158.243


#now refresh the certs, will generate new certs 
sudo microk8s refresh-certs --cert ca.crt

# delete existing lock file for cert reissue
sudo mv /var/snap/microk8s/current/var/lock/no-cert-reissue /var/snap/microk8s/current/var/lock/no-cert-reissue.bak


#check current IPs
ping $(hostname)

#add current node IP and node name
sudo nano /etc/hosts

e.g:
10.13.159.32    SmartBuilding

#now start microk8s

#now restart machine
sudo reboot
